phonegap-questions
==================

Send me your questions about PhoneGap / Apache Cordova (with a focus on iOS) here in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/shazron/phonegap-questions/issues) (don't forget to search the [closed issues](https://github.com/shazron/phonegap-questions/issues?page=1&state=closed) as well). Questions - not bug reports, those should go in the Cordova Issue Tracker [http://issues.cordova.io](http://issues.cordova.io), where any dev can respond to it.

I may put a FAQ in here as well once I accumulate more questions.

##The purpose of this?##

I get personal email with questions regarding PhoneGap. My email is not searchable publicly (I hope not, Gmail!) and sharing knowledge regarding this information is better than being stuck in my email archive. Also, this repo would be searchable by search engines.
